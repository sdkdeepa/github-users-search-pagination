This react app uses the GitHub api to fetch the users upon searching. The user does not need to be logged in to find users.

Note: Github as a rate limit of 60 api calls per hour. So, we are using mock data (20 github users) and storing locally to fetch them.

This app is an example of calling an API from the frontend.
